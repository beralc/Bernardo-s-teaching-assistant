     # Invitation Code System - Setup Guide
     ## What Was Implemented
     A complete invitation code system has been added to
     your app to control access during launch. Here's what's
      new:
     ### 1. Database Tables (INVITATION_SYSTEM.sql)
     **New tables created:**
     - `invitation_codes` - Stores all invitation codes with
      metadata
     … +241 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now let me create one final document to explain
  what still needs to be done - the usage tracking for tier
  limits:

⏺ Write(USAGE_TRACKING_TODO.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 390 lines to USAGE_TRACKING_TODO.md             
     # Usage Tracking Implementation - TODO
     ## Current Status
     The invitation code system is **complete and 
     functional**. Users can sign up with codes, and admins
     can manage codes via the dashboard.
     However, **usage tracking for tier limits is NOT yet 
     implemented**. Right now:
     - ✅ Users have tiers (free, premium)
     - ✅ Database has usage tracking tables
     - ❌ Voice conversations are NOT being logged for usage
      limits
     … +380 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now let me mark all todos as complete and provide
   you with a summary:

⏺ Complete! Here's what I built for you:

  I've successfully implemented the invitation code system
  you requested. This gives you complete control over who
  can sign up for your app during launch.

  What's Ready Now:

  1. Database Setup (INVITATION_SYSTEM.sql)
  - Complete SQL schema for invitation codes, usage
  tracking, and tier management
  - PostgreSQL functions to validate and use codes securely
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for admin-only access
  - Includes 3 starter codes: BETA2025 (50 uses), FOUNDER10
  (10 uses), BERNARDO (unlimited)

  2. Modified Signup Flow (App.js:800-1000)
  - Invitation code is now required to sign up
  - Validates codes in real-time before creating account
  - Automatically applies tier benefits (free vs premium)
  - Shows "Request a code" link for users without codes
  - Clean error messages for invalid/expired codes

  3. Admin Dashboard (App.js:1901-2131)
  - New "Admin" tab in bottom navigation (only visible to
  admins)
  - Generate codes with custom settings:
    - Prefix (BETA, FOUNDER, etc.)
    - Max uses (1 to unlimited)
    - Premium access with duration
    - Tags and descriptions
  - View all codes with usage statistics
  - Activate/deactivate codes on the fly

  4. Documentation Created:
  - INVITATION_SYSTEM_SETUP.md - Complete setup guide with
  step-by-step instructions
  - USAGE_TRACKING_TODO.md - Next steps for implementing
  voice usage limits
  - INVITATION_SYSTEM.sql - Ready-to-run database script

  How to Get Started:

  Step 1: Run the SQL (5 minutes)
  -- Copy everything from INVITATION_SYSTEM.sql
  -- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
  -- Click Run

  Step 2: Make Yourself Admin (2 minutes)
  -- Find your user ID
  SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;

  -- Make yourself admin (replace YOUR_USER_ID)
  UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id =
  'YOUR_USER_ID';

  Step 3: Generate Codes (2 minutes)
  1. Refresh your app
  2. Click "Admin" tab at bottom
  3. Generate your first code (e.g., BETA50)
  4. Share it with beta testers!

  Step 4: Test Signup (3 minutes)
  1. Open app in incognito window
  2. Try signing up without code → blocked ✅
  3. Enter your generated code → works ✅
  4. Check admin panel → usage incremented ✅

  What Still Needs to Be Done:

  Usage tracking for tier limits (documented in
  USAGE_TRACKING_TODO.md):
  - Currently users can talk unlimited minutes (cost risk!)
  - Need to track voice conversation duration
  - Enforce monthly limits (e.g., 30 min free, 300 min
  premium)
  - Show usage stats in user profile

  Estimated time to add: 2-3 hours (well-documented in the
  TODO file)

  Key Features:

  ✅ Security: Row-level security, server-side validation,
  race condition prevention
  ✅ Flexibility: Unlimited custom codes with any settings
  ✅ User Experience: Clear error messages, automatic tier
  assignment
  ✅ Admin Control: Full visibility and management via
  dashboard
  ✅ Scalability: Ready for thousands of codes and users

  File Changes:

  Modified:
  - frontend/frontend-app/src/App.js (+400 lines for
  invitation system + admin UI)

  Created:
  - INVITATION_SYSTEM.sql (complete database setup)
  - INVITATION_SYSTEM_SETUP.md (setup guide)
  - USAGE_TRACKING_TODO.md (next implementation steps)

  You now have a professional invitation-only system similar
   to what apps like Clubhouse and Gmail used during their
  launches! 🚀
