## KEY FRAMING NOTES FOR WRITING:

### This is a LINGUISTICS dissertation. Always emphasize:
1. **Linguistic phenomena** (discourse, interlanguage, acquisition processes)
2. **SLA theory testing** (what do your findings say about Krashen, Swain, Long, etc.?)
3. **Language analysis** (CAF, errors, feedback sequences, negotiation)
4. **Senior learner characteristics** (cognitive, affective, linguistic)

### The technology is a TOOL:
- Don't explain how React works - explain how the tool enables discourse capture
- Don't focus on GPT-4o architecture - focus on how prompts operationalize SLA theory
- Keep technical details in appendices
- Always frame tech in terms of: "This enables investigation of X linguistic phenomenon"

### Your contribution is:
1. **Empirical:** Large corpus of senior learner discourse with AI interlocutor
2. **Theoretical:** Testing SLA theories in novel (AI-mediated) context
3. **Methodological:** Demonstrating how AI can serve SLA research
4. **Practical:** Evidence-based recommendations for teaching senior learners

### Write for an audience of:
- Applied linguists
- SLA researchers
- Language teaching professionals
- NOT computer scientists
