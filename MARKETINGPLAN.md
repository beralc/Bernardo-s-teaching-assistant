## Crisis Management & Reputation

### Potential Issues

**Issue 1: "AI will replace teachers!"**
**Response:**
"Bernardo's English Helper is a practice tool, not a teacher replacement.
It provides unlimited practice opportunities that complement human instruction.
Think of it like a textbook - a tool that supports learning, not a replacement for teachers."

**Issue 2: "It's too expensive"**
**Response:**
"Let's compare: A human tutor costs $30-50/hour. Our unlimited practice
costs $39/month - less than one hour of tutoring. For schools, it's
even more affordable per student."

**Issue 3: "Technology is too complicated for seniors"**
**Response:**
"We designed this specifically for seniors with large fonts, simple interface,
and patient AI. Our oldest user is 78 and practices daily. We offer free
onboarding and support."

**Issue 4: "Data privacy concerns"**
**Response:**
"We take privacy seriously. All data is encrypted, stored securely on
Supabase (SOC 2 compliant), and never sold. Users can delete their data
anytime. Full privacy policy available."

### Review Management

**Monitor:**

## Summary

**This marketing plan focuses on:**

1. **B2B as primary revenue driver** (schools, centers, corporate)
2. **Content marketing for organic growth** (SEO, blog, YouTube)
3. **Direct outreach for quick wins** (cold email, LinkedIn)
4. **Community building for retention** (Facebook groups, webinars)
5. **Paid ads for scale** (Google, Facebook - test small first)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Start with what's free (content, organic social)
- Test paid channels with small budgets
- Double down on what works
- Build relationships, not just transactions
- Focus on ROI, not vanity metrics

**Remember:**
- Marketing is a marathon, not a sprint
- Consistency beats intensity
- Data-driven decisions
- Customer success is your best marketing

**Goal:** $10k MRR in 6 months is ambitious but achievable with consistent execution.
